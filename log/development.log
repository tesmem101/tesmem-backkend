DEPRECATION WARNING: The behavior of `attribute_changed?` inside of after callbacks will be changing in the next version of Rails. The new return value will reflect the behavior of calling the method after `save` returned (e.g. the opposite of what it returns now). To maintain the current behavior, use `saved_change_to_attribute?` instead. (called from move_profile_photo_to_image_table at /home/hasan/Tesmem/tesmem-backend/tesmem/app/models/user.rb:53)

DEPRECATION WARNING: The behavior of `attribute_changed?` inside of after callbacks will be changing in the next version of Rails. The new return value will reflect the behavior of calling the method after `save` returned (e.g. the opposite of what it returns now). To maintain the current behavior, use `saved_change_to_attribute?` instead. (called from move_profile_photo_to_image_table at /home/hasan/Tesmem/tesmem-backend/tesmem/app/models/user.rb:53)

DEPRECATION WARNING: The behavior of `attribute_changed?` inside of after callbacks will be changing in the next version of Rails. The new return value will reflect the behavior of calling the method after `save` returned (e.g. the opposite of what it returns now). To maintain the current behavior, use `saved_change_to_attribute?` instead. (called from move_profile_photo_to_image_table at /home/hasan/Tesmem/tesmem-backend/tesmem/app/models/user.rb:53)
